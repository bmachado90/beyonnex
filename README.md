## Solution

- Language/Framework: Cypress + TS
- Solution must run on Docket

### Setup

Have the nodejs https://nodejs.org/en/ installed for your os.

Once installed go to the project's root folder and type on your terminal:

`npm install`

If you want to run the test using cypress test runner you can type:

`npm run cy:open`
